      <p class="c2 mb-3">
        <span class="c3 c0">
          CaloPPA is the first state law in the country to mandate the posting of a privacy statement on commercial
          websites and online services. The law's reach extends well beyond California, requiring anyone or any
          organization operating websites in the United States (or perhaps the entire world) that collect personally
          identifiable information from California consumers to post a clear privacy statement on their website, adhere to
          it, and disclose exactly what information is being collected and with whom it will be shared.

          <br>
          <br>

          According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:
          <br>
          <br>
          Access to our website is open to anonymous users. As soon as this privacy statement is finished, a link to it
          will be added to our home page or, at the very least, the first important page you see when you visit our

          mentioned above.

          Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:

          • By calling us
          <br>
          <br>
          How does our site handle not track signals?

          <br>
          <br>
          We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT)
          browser mechanism is in place.

      <p class="c2 mb-3">
        <span class="c3 c0">
          The Fair Information Practices Principles are the cornerstone of American privacy legislation, and the ideas
          they encompass have had a big impact on the evolution of data protection laws all over the world. Compliance
          with the different privacy regulations that safeguard personal information requires an understanding of the Fair
          Information Practice Principles and how they should be put into practice.
          <br>
          <br>

          In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a
          data breach occur:
        </span>

        </li>
        <li class="c14 c6 li-bullet-0">

            Within 1 business day

        </li>

      </ul>

      <p class="c2 mb-3">
        <span class="c3 c0">
          We also concur with the Individual Redress Principle, which mandates that people have the ability to legally
          hold negligent data collectors and processors accountable. This concept mandates that people have recourse to
          courts or government entities to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors, in addition to
          having enforceable rights against data users.
